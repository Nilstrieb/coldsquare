in this project I try to implement a JVM  
this project has no clear goal, I just continue it whenever I don't have any other project idea  

my goal is not to make a fully working jvm that will run your spring application at blazing speed

it would be amazing if it even managed to run a hello world

## what i have for now:
* Almost working complete `.class` file parser
* Primitive file info for `.class` files similar to `javap`
